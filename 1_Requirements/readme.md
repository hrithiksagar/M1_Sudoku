# How is it Helpful?
* Just like physical exercise, your mind need some exercise too. Playing sudoku actually exercises your brain extensively. Here are the amazing benefits of playing Sudoku:

* Improves your memory. Memory and logic work side-by-side when you are playing Sudoku. We use our memory to memorize the numbers, when we use our logic to figure out the next blank.
* Stimulates your mind. It keeps you practicing your logical thinking process when you are solving a puzzle, and eventually improve your number skills.
* Reduces the chances of developing Alzheimers by keeping your brain active.
* Learns to do things quickly. Not only playing Sudoku is interesting but it helps to increase your sense of time. You will learn how to make a decision and take an action with less hesitation.
* Increases your concentration power. Sudoku requires players to think strategically and solve problems creatively. Once you stop playing in the middle of the game, you have to start the whole thinking process, which helps you to develop your concentration power and re-focus skills.
* Feel Happy. Sudoku gives you a sense of accomplishment when you can solve a puzzle, especially the puzzle is a difficult one.
